# Double Trouble

The Developer

Designed and built by Dana Palazzo. This was my first project as a part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Remote program.

The Game

A new take on the original race-and-chase Pop-o-matic Trouble Game. The game features two players who compete to move their game piece around the board and return it back to its safe place. If the players land on eachother's piece, it's returned to its original safe place and starts from the beginning. Whoever gets their game piece around the board and back to its safe place first wins!

The Code

I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to build the game. 

The Approach

I hard coded the game board in order to create a square of circles in the middle with the players on either side to emulate the actual game board. I used jQuery to then produce event listeners which would generate "die rolls" and movement of the game pieces. By creating objects for each player which contained whether their game pieces were safe and on which game board circle they were positioned, and by creating arrays which held the names of the game board circles and whether they were filled, I could then advance the game pieces.
