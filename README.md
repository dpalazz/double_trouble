# Double Trouble

The Developer

Designed and built by Dana Palazzo. This was her first project as a part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Remote program.

The Game

A new take on the original race-and-chase Pop-o-matic Trouble Game. The game features two players who compete to move their two pawns around the board and return them back to their safe places first.
